    wikivir is a thing that I made for a class at CSU Chico, mostly because like,
    listen, I love malware.  the problem is, there aren't a lot of good places to
    talk about or work on it in a collaborative fashion.  there's been some changes
    along these lines (see ghidra's collaborative options, for example), but we've
    yet to see a good way to do this.  view this as a proof of concept, more than
    a finished thing

    atm, it can only accept and analyze <i>anything</i> that the gnu binutils can
    handle.  so, mostly this means <a href="{% url 'topicView' topic='ELF' %}">ELF</a> and 
    some <a href="{% url 'topicView' topic='PE' %}">PE</a> handling abilities.  so that means no macro viruses, no weird parse problems
    that lead to vulns, etc etc
